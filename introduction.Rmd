# Introduction

Heavy metal exposure during pregnancy can have serious consequences for both the mother and the child[@CDC_2023]. These toxic elements can easily cross the placenta and enter the fetus, where they can disrupt normal development and lead to a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), posing significant risks to maternal and fetal well-being[@CDC_2023; @Padula2020; @Wai2017]. APOs associated with heavy metal exposure include an increased likelihood of preterm birth, low birthweight, and the possibility of developmental delays and intellectual impairments in the child[@Wai2017]. Such outcomes can have far-reaching consequences, impacting the health and quality of life of both mothers and their children, with potential long-term health complications[@Nozadi2021]. Safeguarding pregnant women from heavy metal exposure is paramount to ensure the healthy development of the next generation[@CDC_2023; @Nozadi2021; @Padula2020; @Wai2017].

There are a number of maternal health factors that have been linked to APOs, including maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), diabetes status, and hypertensive disorders[@Ke2023; @kurbasic2018]. These factors can interact with each other in complex ways, making it difficult to understand the full impact of each factor on APOs. Also, the impact of heavy metal exposure on APOs is complex and depends on a number of factors, including the type of metal, the level of exposure, and the individual's overall health[@Jaishankar2014; @Bank-Nielsen2019; @michael2022]. Some heavy metals, such as lead, are known to have a negative impact on APOs, even at low levels of exposure. Lead can interfere with the development of APOs, leading to problems with cognitive function, behavior, and motor skills[@Sanders2009; @silver2016]. Other heavy metals that have been linked to lower APOs include cadmium, mercury, and arsenic. These metals can damage the placenta and interfere with the development of the fetus's brain[@gundacker2012; @niph]. As a result, babies born to mothers who have been exposed to these metals may have lower APOs and be at increased risk for developmental problems. Heavy metals, such as mercury, can also have a negative impact on APOs, but the effects are not as well-understood[@bj√∏rklund2019;].

The impact of maternal heavy metal exposure on APOs is particularly concerning, as it can lead to long-term health problems for the child. For example, studies have shown that children born to mothers who were exposed to lead during pregnancy are more likely to have lower IQ scores, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and learning disabilities[@Lee2018; @Sabra2017; @niph].

It is important to note that the impact of heavy metal exposure on APOs is not always negative. Some heavy metals, such as zinc, are essential for normal brain development[@asindi2022]. However, even essential heavy metals can be harmful if they are present in excess.

Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a statistical technique that can be used to examine the complex relationships between multiple variables. SEM can be used to identify and measure latent factors, which are underlying constructs that cannot be directly observed[@hair2021]. In the context of this study, latent factors could include things like overall maternal health, genetic risk, and environmental exposures.

The purpose of this study was to use structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the impact of maternal heavy metal exposure on adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs). The study was conducted using a prospective cohort of pregnant women. Heavy metal levels were measured before pregnancy, and APOs were assessed at birth. SEM was used to examine the relationships between heavy metal levels, latent factors, and APOs.

The results of the study showed that maternal heavy metal exposure was associated with an increased risk of a number of APOs, including low birthweight, preterm birth, and developmental delays. The results also showed that the impact of maternal heavy metal exposure on APOs was mediated by latent factors, such as overall maternal health and genetic risk.
