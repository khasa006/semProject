# Conclusion

This study provides compelling evidence of the relationships between pre-pregnancy heavy metals exposure, maternal health factors and adverse pregnancy outcomes, specifically chromosomal anomalies and Down syndrome in newborns. The results emphasize the importance of considering the combined effects of maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, diabetes, and hypertensive disorders on pregnancy outcomes. Employing latent variable analysis offers a comprehensive approach to studying the intricate associations between pre-pregnancy heavy metals exposure, maternal health factors and adverse pregnancy outcomes. By unraveling these complex relationships, healthcare professionals can develop targeted strategies to improve maternal and fetal health during pregnancy.

Further research should delve deeper into the underlying mechanisms linking these factors and explore potential interventions to mitigate the risks associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Enhanced understanding of these relationships will aid in developing personalized and evidence-based strategies to optimize maternal and fetal health outcomes.

Overall, the findings of this study suggest that pre-pregnancy heavy metals exposure and maternal health factors play a significant role in determining pregnancy outcomes. By understanding these factors and their interactions, healthcare professionals can develop targeted interventions to improve maternal and fetal health.
