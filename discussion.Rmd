# Discussion

The present study investigated the relationships between pre-pregnancy heavy metals exposure, maternal health factors, and child anomalies. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model showed that the model fits the data well. The structural equation model (SEM) also showed that the model fits the data well and that there were significant relationships between the latent variables.

The findings of this study suggest that pre-pregnancy heavy metals exposure and maternal health factors are both associated with an increased risk of child anomalies. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown a link between environmental pollutants and birth defects. The findings of this study also suggest that the effects of pre-pregnancy heavy metals exposure and maternal health factors on child anomalies may be additive. This means that the risk of child anomalies may be even higher in women who are exposed to both pre-pregnancy heavy metals and have poor maternal health.

The application of latent variable analysis in this study offers a robust framework for understanding the complex interrelationships among maternal health factors and their impact on adverse pregnancy outcomes. This approach allows for the simultaneous assessment of multiple maternal health factors, as well as the identification of latent factors that may be driving these associations. This information can be used to develop more targeted and effective interventions to improve maternal and fetal health.

The findings of this study have important implications for public health. They suggest that exposure to environmental pollutants during pregnancy may be a significant risk factor for child anomalies. This is particularly important for women who are already at risk of having a child with anomalies, such as those who have a family history of birth defects. The findings of this study also suggest that it is important to take steps to reduce exposure to environmental pollutants during pregnancy. 

In addition to the findings of this study, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that maternal health factors can also impact the long-term health of the offspring. For example, maternal obesity has been linked to an increased risk of childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is important to consider the long-term implications of maternal health factors when developing interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes.

The present study has some limitations. First, the study was conducted in South Florida, so the findings may not be generalizable to other populations. Second, the study was based on self-reported data, which may be subject to recall bias. Third, the study did not assess the specific mechanisms by which pre-pregnancy heavy metals exposure and maternal health factors may increase the risk of child anomalies.

Despite these limitations, the findings of this study provide important insights into the relationships between pre-pregnancy heavy metals exposure, maternal health factors, and child anomalies. These findings could be used to develop interventions to reduce the risk of child anomalies in the future.
