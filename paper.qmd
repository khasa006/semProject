# Introduction

Heavy metal exposure during pregnancy can have serious consequences for both the mother and the child[@CDC_2023]. These toxic elements can easily cross the placenta and enter the fetus, where they can disrupt normal development and lead to a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), posing significant risks to maternal and fetal well-being[@CDC_2023; @Padula2020; @Wai2017]. APOs associated with heavy metal exposure include an increased likelihood of preterm birth, low birthweight, and the possibility of developmental delays and intellectual impairments in the child[@Wai2017]. Such outcomes can have far-reaching consequences, impacting the health and quality of life of both mothers and their children, with potential long-term health complications[@Nozadi2021]. Safeguarding pregnant women from heavy metal exposure is paramount to ensure the healthy development of the next generation[@CDC_2023; @Nozadi2021; @Padula2020; @Wai2017].

There are a number of maternal health factors that have been linked to APOs, including maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), diabetes status, and hypertensive disorders[@Ke2023; @kurbasic2018]. These factors can interact with each other in complex ways, making it difficult to understand the full impact of each factor on APOs. Also, the impact of heavy metal exposure on APOs is complex and depends on a number of factors, including the type of metal, the level of exposure, and the individual's overall health[@Jaishankar2014; @Bank-Nielsen2019; @michael2022]. Some heavy metals, such as lead, are known to have a negative impact on APOs, even at low levels of exposure. Lead can interfere with the development of APOs, leading to problems with cognitive function, behavior, and motor skills[@Sanders2009; @silver2016]. Other heavy metals that have been linked to lower APOs include cadmium, mercury, and arsenic. These metals can damage the placenta and interfere with the development of the fetus's brain[@gundacker2012; @niph]. As a result, babies born to mothers who have been exposed to these metals may have lower APOs and be at increased risk for developmental problems. Heavy metals, such as mercury, can also have a negative impact on APOs, but the effects are not as well-understood[@bjørklund2019;].

The impact of maternal heavy metal exposure on APOs is particularly concerning, as it can lead to long-term health problems for the child. For example, studies have shown that children born to mothers who were exposed to lead during pregnancy are more likely to have lower IQ scores, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and learning disabilities[@Lee2018; @Sabra2017; @niph].

It is important to note that the impact of heavy metal exposure on APOs is not always negative. Some heavy metals, such as zinc, are essential for normal brain development[@asindi2022]. However, even essential heavy metals can be harmful if they are present in excess.

Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a statistical technique that can be used to examine the complex relationships between multiple variables. SEM can be used to identify and measure latent factors, which are underlying constructs that cannot be directly observed[@hair2021]. In the context of this study, latent factors could include things like overall maternal health, genetic risk, and environmental exposures.

The purpose of this study was to use structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the impact of maternal heavy metal exposure on adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs). The study was conducted using a prospective cohort of pregnant women. Heavy metal levels were measured before pregnancy, and APOs were assessed at birth. SEM was used to examine the relationships between heavy metal levels, latent factors, and APOs.

The results of the study showed that maternal heavy metal exposure was associated with an increased risk of a number of APOs, including low birthweight, preterm birth, and developmental delays. The results also showed that the impact of maternal heavy metal exposure on APOs was mediated by latent factors, such as overall maternal health and genetic risk.

# Methods

This study used data from several databases (Florida Vital Statistics, EPA's Air quality System etc.) to evaluate the relationship between air pollution and birth outcomes of pregnant residents in South Florida (Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach Counties). 

The study included all live singleton births in South Florida from 2020 to 2021. The data for the study were collected from medical records of 46,305 pregnant women. The data included information on maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, diabetes status, and hypertensive disorders. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were measured as chromosomal anomalies and Down syndrome in newborns.

Air-quality and meteorological data were obtained from the EPA’s Air Quality System. For each sample, data were linked by residence county and then averaged by trimester.

## Lasso Regression

Lasso regression is a type of linear regression that uses a regularization term called L1 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalizability[@tibshirani1996; ]. The L1 regularization term adds a penalty to the absolute value of the regression variables' coefficients. This shrinks some of the coefficients to zero and effectively performs feature selection. This means that the final model only has a subset of the most important variables. This can help to make the model easier to understand and use. Lasso regression is often used when there are a lot of variables and it's hard to figure out which ones are most important for predicting the outcome variable[@tibshirani1996; @friedman2010; @fonti2017feature].

The general equation for the Lasso regression model:

$y=β_0+β_1 x_1+β_2 x_2+...+β_p x_p+ε; \text{subject to}∑∥β_j∥≤t$

, where: y is the outcome variable,

$x_1,x_2,...,x_p$ are the predictor variables,

$β_0,β_1,β_2,...,β_p$ are the regression coefficients,

$ε$ is the error term,

$t$ is a constant that determines the amount of regularization,

$|β_j|$ represents the absolute value of $β_j$.

The goal of Lasso regression is to find the values of $β_0,β_1,β_2,...,β_p$ that minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual values of $y$, given that the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients is less than or equal to $t$. This makes it more likely that the number of coefficients will be small, and many of them will be shrunk to zero. The final model will only have the variables with coefficients that are not zero. This can help to simplify the model and make it easier to understand[@tibshirani1996; @breiman1995]. The proposed study will use lasso regression to examine which metals and metals mixture are associated with birth anomalies and mothers health.

## Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)

Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate statistical technique that is used to examine complex relationships among variables and test theoretical models[@beran2010]. It allows researchers to assess both the direct and indirect effects of latent constructs on observed variables, making it valuable for investigating complex research questions. In SEM, researchers begin by specifying a theoretical model that represents the hypothesized relationships between latent constructs and observed variables[@beran2010; @fan2016]. The model is represented graphically using path diagrams, illustrating the relationships between constructs and their indicators.

### Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)

CFA is a subset of SEM used to assess the measurement properties of the latent constructs by examining their relationships with observed indicators. It helps confirm whether the observed variables adequately measure the underlying constructs[@mueller2001a]. Researchers specify the model by defining the factor loadings, which represent the strength of the relationship between each observed indicator and its corresponding latent construct, and potentially adding covariances between the indicators[@mueller2001a; @yadav2022]. For CFA to yield meaningful results, several assumptions must be met, including:

-   Each latent construct should be measured by multiple observed indicators.

-   The observed indicators should be related to their respective constructs.

-   The measurement errors of the observed indicators should be uncorrelated.

To evaluate the goodness of fit of the CFA model, various fit indices are used, such as the chi-square test, Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR). Researchers should aim for a good fit of the model to the data, as indicated by values close to 1 for CFI and TLI, and low values (e.g., below 0.08) for RMSEA and SRMR[@xia2018; @cangur2015].

### Structural Model and Path Analysis

Once the measurement model (CFA) is confirmed, researchers can proceed to test the structural model, which examines the relationships between the latent constructs. This involves estimating the paths between constructs and testing for direct and indirect effects. Researchers can also include covariances between constructs or other exogenous variables in the model[@allen2017; @mueller2001a; @hair2021].

Estimation of the model is typically done using maximum likelihood estimation (ML) or other appropriate techniques, aiming to find the best-fitting model that accounts for the observed data[@fan2016; @Shi2020]. It is common to modify the initial model based on theoretical considerations and modification indices (suggestions for model improvement). Iteration may be required to arrive at a more accurate representation of the underlying relationships[@Gunzler2015; @Deng2018].

Structural Equation Modeling with Confirmatory Factor Analysis is a robust statistical approach to test complex theoretical models and explore the relationships between latent constructs and observed variables[@fan2016]. It allows researchers to gain insights into the underlying structure of their data and provide evidence for the validity of their measurement instruments. Properly conducted SEM can significantly contribute to the advancement of research in various fields[@Deng2018; @fan2016; @beran2010].

## Data Analysis

Lasso regression analysis was conducted to identify the most important predictors of child anomalies. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, select relevant columns, and scale numeric predictors. The data was split into training and testing sets using 5-fold cross-validation. For each of the three time periods (pregestational, trim1, and trim2), a logistic regression model with Lasso regularization was specified. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to select the best model based on one standard error rule. The selected Lasso model was trained on the training data.

The performance of the trained Lasso models was evaluated on the training data by calculating accuracy, ROC AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and generating a confusion matrix. Additionally, variable importance was assessed for each model using the vip package to identify the top important features.

Finally, the trained Lasso models were used to make predictions on the test dataset, and their performance was evaluated on the test data using density plots, ROC curves, and ROC AUC. Variable importance for the test data was also assessed to understand the significance of predictors.

Based on the results of lasso regression, we found that lasso regression with trimester 1 has better prediction accuracy than other two models. We used top three most important trimester 1 metals in our SEM analysis.

Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was conducted to examine the relationships among latent variables and observed variables in the birthMetalData dataset. Initially, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) model was specified, with three latent variables: trim1, maternal_health, and child_anom. These latent variables were indicated by sets of observed variables, forming measurement models.

Next, a Structural Equation Model (SEM) was extended from the CFA model to include structural paths. Direct effects were specified between the trim1 and child_anom latent variables. Additionally, indirect effects were specified between the trim1 and maternal_health latent variables and the child_anom latent variable.

The SEM model was fitted to the data using the diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) estimator. Model fit measures, such as chi-square, degrees of freedom, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), were computed to assess model fit. Standardized estimates for factor loadings and path coefficients were also examined.

The resulting SEM model was visualized using a path diagram to illustrate the relationships among latent variables and observed variables.

The SEM analysis was conducted using the DWLS estimator with the NLMINB optimization method. Analyses were conducted with `r stringr::word(R.Version()$version.string, 1, 3)` with the `lavaan` (`r packageVersion("lavaan")`), `tidyverse` (`r packageVersion("tidyverse")`), `rUM` (`r packageVersion("rUM")`), `table1` (`r packageVersion("table1")`) packages used to preprocess and summarize data.[@R-base; @R-tidyverse; @tidyverse2019; @R-rUM; @R-table1]

# Results

The mother health characteristics in the study are shown in Table 1. The average age of the mothers was 30.77 years, with a standard deviation of 5.69 years. This means that most of the mothers' ages were within 5.69 years of the average age. The standard deviation for pre-pregnancy BMI was 5.90, indicating that there was some variability in the mothers' BMIs before pregnancy. The average weight gain during pregnancy was 29.41 pounds, with a standard deviation of 15.73 pounds. This means that there was significant variation in the amount of weight gain among the pregnant mothers. The study found that diabetes was prevalent in 0.6% of the mothers, chronic hypertension in 1.5%, pre-eclampsia in 6.9%, and eclampsia in 0.2%. These conditions were relatively rare among the study population. The prevalence of chromosomal anomalies, Down syndrome, heart anomalies, and diaphragmatic hernias was exceedingly low. For all four anomalies, each was present in less than 0.1% of the infants.

Table 2 compares three Lasso Regression models (lasso regression with three different time points) on four metrics. The metrics are accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC AUC. ROC AUC is a performance metric that quantifies the overall performance of the model in binary classification tasks. The ROC AUC values for the three models were 0.43, 0.48, and 0.41, respectively. These results suggest that the lasso regression model with trimester 1 is the best model for predicting the outcome of a pregnancy (child birth anomalies).

The variable importance plot (VIP plot) in Figure 1 shows the most important metals in trimester 1. The VIP plot is a measure of how important each metal is for predicting the outcome of a pregnancy. The metals with the highest VIP scores are the most important for predicting the child birth anomalies. The three most important metals in trimester 1 are zirconium, vanadium, and zinc. These metals have the highest VIP scores, which means that they are the most important for predicting the child birth anomalies. We used the top three most important metals (zirconium, vanadium, and zinc) in our SEM analysis.

The results of the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) model show that the model fits the data well. The CFI and TLI values are both above 0.99, which indicates that the model fits the data very well. The RMSEA value is 0.012, which is below the recommended cutoff of 0.05, further supporting the model's good fit to the data.

For example, "trim1" represents the top three most important first trimester heavy metals exposure, and it is measured by indicators like "trim1_Zirconim," "trim1_Vanadium," and "trim1_Zinc." The standardized factor loadings for these indicators indicate how strongly they are related to the latent variable "trim1." Similarly, "maternal_health" is measured by indicators like "MOTHER_AGE," "PrePrgnncy_BMI," "MR_DIAB," "MR_HYPERT_CHRO," and "MR_HYPERT_ECLA." The factor loadings for these indicators represent the strength of their relationship with the latent variable "maternal_health." Finally, "child_anom" is measured by indicators "ANOM_CHROM" and "ANOM_DOWNS," and their factor loadings represent their associations with the latent variable "child_anom."

The "Std.lv" and "Std.all" columns provide the standardized factor loadings. These values show the extent to which each indicator contributes to its corresponding latent variable. Higher standardized factor loadings indicate stronger associations between the latent variable and the observed indicators. For example, the indicator "trim1_Zirconim" has a standardized factor loading of 0.888 in the "trim1" latent variable, which suggests a strong relationship between Zirconim levels during first trimester (the indicator) and the prenatal nutritional component (the latent variable). Similarly, other indicators also have relatively high standardized factor loadings, indicating significant contributions to their respective latent variables.

The model includes covariances between different latent variables and their indicators, representing the degree of shared variance between the observed variables and the underlying latent variables. For example, there is a covariance between the latent variables "trim1" and "maternal_health," which is -0.003. This indicates a small negative relationship between maternal heavy metals exposure (indicated by "trim1") and maternal health-related indicators. Similarly, there is a covariance of 0.493 between "maternal_health" and "child_anom," suggesting a moderate positive relationship between maternal health factors and child anomalies.

The results of this CFA model suggest that the five latent variables are all valid measures of the constructs they are intended to measure. The model also shows that there are significant correlations between the latent variables, which suggests that they are all related to each other.

The results of the structural equation model (SEM) showed that the model fits the data well. The chi-square test statistic was significant, indicating a significant difference between the user model and the baseline model. The Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) values were 0,993 and 0.991, respectively, suggesting a good fit between the user model and the data.

The latent variables in the measurement model were "trim1", "maternal_health", and "child_anom". The standardized factor loadings represent the relationship between the latent variables and their corresponding observed variables. All factor loadings were statistically significant (p \< 0.001) indicating a strong relationship between the latent variables and their indicators.

The regression analysis examined the relationships between the "trim1" and "maternal_health" latent variables with the "child_anom" latent variable. here is a significant positive relationship between maternal health ("maternal_helth") and child anomalies ("child_anom"). An increase in maternal health predicts an increase in child anomalies, with a standardized coefficient of 0.615. On the other hand, the relationship between child anomalies ("child_anom") and top three first trimester heavy metals exposure ("trim1") is not statistically significant.

The intercepts represent the estimated mean values of the latent variables. The intercepts for the observed variables were generally small and non-significant, indicating that the latent variables adequately capture the variance in the data. Thresholds represent the cut-off values for categorical observed variables. All thresholds were statistically significant (p \< 0.001), indicating the discrimination power of the thresholds.

The variances represent the estimated error variances for the observed variables. Higher values indicate greater variability in the observed variables. The variances for the observed variables ranged from 0.095 to 31.406, with all estimates being statistically significant (p \< 0.001). This suggests that the observed variables capture a considerable amount of variability in the data.

The results of the SEM analysis indicate that the user model provided a good fit to the data. The measurement model demonstrated strong factor loadings, suggesting that the latent variables were well-represented by their indicators. The regression analysis revealed significant relationships between the latent variables, indicating the influence of "trim1" and "maternal_health" on "child_anom". The findings provide insights into the relationships between the variables and contribute to our understanding of the studied phenomenon.

# Discussion

The present study investigated the relationships between maternal heavy metals exposure, maternal health factors, and child anomalies. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model showed that the model fits the data well. The structural equation model (SEM) also showed that the model fits the data well and that there were significant relationships between the latent variables.

The findings of this study suggest that maternal heavy metals exposure and maternal health factors are both associated with an increased risk of child anomalies. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown a link between environmental pollutants and birth defects. The findings of this study also suggest that the effects of maternal heavy metals exposure and maternal health factors on child anomalies may be additive. This means that the risk of child anomalies may be even higher in women who are exposed to both maternal heavy metals and have poor maternal health.

The application of latent variable analysis in this study offers a robust framework for understanding the complex interrelationships among maternal health factors and their impact on adverse pregnancy outcomes[@Mainolfi2013]. This approach allows for the simultaneous assessment of multiple maternal health factors, as well as the identification of latent factors that may be driving these associations. This information can be used to develop more targeted and effective interventions to improve maternal and fetal health[@Mainolfi2013;@Mitku2021].

The findings of this study have important implications for public health. They suggest that exposure to environmental pollutants during pregnancy may be a significant risk factor for child anomalies. This is particularly important for women who are already at risk of having a child with anomalies, such as those who have a family history of birth defects. The findings of this study also suggest that it is important to take steps to reduce exposure to environmental pollutants during pregnancy.

In addition to the findings of this study, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that maternal health factors can also impact the long-term health of the offspring. For example, maternal obesity has been linked to an increased risk of childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease[@Godfrey2017;@Kankowski2022]. Therefore, it is important to consider the long-term implications of maternal health factors when developing interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes.

The present study has some limitations. First, the study was conducted in South Florida, so the findings may not be generalizable to other populations. Second, the study was based on self-reported data, which may be subject to recall bias. Third, the study did not assess the specific mechanisms by which maternal heavy metals exposure and maternal health factors may increase the risk of child anomalies.

Despite these limitations, the findings of this study provide important insights into the relationships between maternal heavy metals exposure, maternal health factors, and child anomalies. These findings could be used to develop interventions to reduce the risk of child anomalies in the future.

# Conclusion

This study provides compelling evidence of the relationships between maternal heavy metals exposure, maternal health factors and adverse pregnancy outcomes, specifically chromosomal anomalies and Down syndrome in newborns. The results emphasize the importance of considering the combined effects of maternal age, pre-pregnency BMI, diabetes, and hypertensive disorders on pregnancy outcomes. Employing latent variable analysis offers a comprehensive approach to studying the intricate associations between maternal heavy metals exposure, maternal health factors and adverse pregnancy outcomes. By unraveling these complex relationships, healthcare professionals can develop targeted strategies to improve maternal and fetal health during pregnancy.

Further research should delve deeper into the underlying mechanisms linking these factors and explore potential interventions to mitigate the risks associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Enhanced understanding of these relationships will aid in developing personalized and evidence-based strategies to optimize maternal and fetal health outcomes.

Overall, the findings of this study suggest that aternal heavy metals exposure and maternal health factors play a significant role in determining pregnancy outcomes. By understanding these factors and their interactions, healthcare professionals can develop targeted interventions to improve maternal and fetal health.
